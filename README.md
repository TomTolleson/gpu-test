# GPU Test

A project to benchmark GPU performance using Hugging Face models.

So I found an old Nvidia GeForce-750 in my closet and thought "it probably doesn't support modern PyTorch, but I can try."
I tried. It does not. However, I'm keeping this repo to as a record of my GPU testing history. Call it a learning experience, or a collection of failed experiments. Maybe a way of looking back that isn't as jarring as when I bought an old Commodore 64 and thought I would enjoy Pascal (which was too expensive of a package for my 14 year old self).


## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
